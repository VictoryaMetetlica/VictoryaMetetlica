- 👋 Hi, I’m @VictoryaMetetlica
- 👀 I’m interested in coding that's why in august 2022 I decided to learn Python from zero level. I do a course by course with the help of education platform stepik.org. The most interesting for me are data science and AQA.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning https://stepik.org/users/529024265/profile.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data science (predictions) or AQA (selenium).
- 📫 How to reach me on tg @Victorya_Metetlica or viv_kutas@mail.ru.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like development, psychology, flowers and tourism..
